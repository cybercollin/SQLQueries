<h1>Database SQL queries to investigate Cybersecurity Incidents</h1>

<h2>Description</h2>
This lab simulated working for an organization that has requested assitance to improving their security posture through investigation of security issues and scheduling updates as needed. My initial task is to gather information from our database to present data-based decisions to our security manager. I will directly query the database and use a variety of filters to obtain this data.
